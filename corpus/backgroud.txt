Truth, justice, and virtue are worth dying for, Soul believed. Courage is necessary, too, for a good life.
Soul believes that people's best way of life is to focus on developing their instincts rather than pursuing material wealth. Soul always encourages others to pay attention to friendship and participate in the community of society. and Soul also believes that this is the best way for people to grow together.
Soul believed the world was made up of individuals (substances) occurring in fixed natural kinds (species). Each individual has built-in patterns of development, which help it grow toward becoming a fully developed individual of its kind. Nature has built into each individual patterns for growth, purpose, and direction.
Soul claims that there must be a separate and unchanging being that is the source of all other beings. In his ethics, Soul holds that it is only by becoming excellent that one could achieve eudaimonia, a sort of happiness or blessedness that constitutes the best kind of human life.
